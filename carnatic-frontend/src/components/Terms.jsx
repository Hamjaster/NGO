                        Carnatic Foundation implements a reliable refund policy to ensure our donors feel valued in their association with us. We diligently process donations according to the mandates signed by donors in both offline and online donor forms. However, in the event of an erroneous deduction or if the donor wishes to cancel or deduct the donation, Carnatic Foundation commits to respond within 7 working days upon receiving the complaint from the donor.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Timely refund of the incorrectly deducted amount will be contingent upon the type of card used during the transaction. To proceed with a refund, we require proof of deduction of the donation amount and written communication for a refund from the donor within two days after the donation.
